# Pong
This is the first advanced game that I have started working on.
I have made a pong game before in Lua but I would like to go deeper
than what I did before, and I am more familiar with C/C++ than Lua so
I expect a better outcome.

Most of the basic starting code to create a window and whatnot are copy-pasted
from the SFML learn page. The rest is probably a combination of mostly my intuition, 
trial and error, and reddit and stackoverflow.
